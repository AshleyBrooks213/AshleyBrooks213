### Hey there! I'm Ashley.


Welcome to my GitHub! I do a lot of Machine Learning and have a lot of projects that I have really enoyed working on. Check out Franken-BERT! A teammate and I worked together to create a state-of-the-art Google BERT model to be used in production for a product called Blue Witness. This product is for a non-for-profit called Human Rights First and it will be used to detect whether a Tweet post contains a possible True case of Police brutality.
During the pandemic, I found something that I am genuinely passionate about and enjoy doing. I fell in love with data. 
I currently work as a Support Hour Lead at Lambda School. I get work with students and help them with their understanding of the core Data Science cirriculum. I have learned so much from the students and have really enjoyed my time here. 
If you are interested in collaborating on a project, I am up for anything! 
Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-brooks91/) 
I am looking for full-time oppotunites!


âš¡ Fun fact: ...I am a total Lord of the Rings nerd!
